# Leaflet Before/After Map Comparison Slider

This is the demo showing how we can use 2 different Leaflet Maps to compare, or display side by side to show a before-after effect or something similar to that. You can find the demo in the description of this repository.

## How to use?

* Change `constants.js` file inside `js` directory.
* Changes you can make:
	* Center of the Map
	* Zoom Level
	* Both the Tile Layer urls
* To change the handle, replace `img/handle.gif` with your own `handle.gif` file.
